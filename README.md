## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information on unemployment rates across different regions and demographics. The key features include:

- **Date**: The time period of the data (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- **Region**: The geographical area (e.g., country, state).
- **Unemployment Rate**: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, education level, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this phase, I explored the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, detect missing values, and identify trends over time. Key visualizations include:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Unemployment trends over time.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Relationships between different variables.
- **Box Plots**: Distribution of unemployment rates across demographics.

## Modeling and Prediction

I developed predictive models to forecast future unemployment rates using the following techniques:

- **Linear Regression**: A basic model to understand linear relationships.
- **Random Forest**: A more advanced model to capture complex patterns.
- **ARIMA**: A time-series model for forecasting.

The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Visualization

Interactive visualizations were created using Plotly to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and predictions. Key visualizations include:

- **Historical Performance Graphs**: Visualization of unemployment trends.
- **Predictive Graphs**: Future unemployment rate predictions.

## Results and Insights

The analysis revealed key insights into factors driving unemployment and provided accurate predictions for future trends. These findings can help policymakers in decision-making processes to address unemployment challenges.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the power of data analysis and predictive modeling in understanding and forecasting unemployment trends. The insights gained can be valuable for stakeholders in planning and policy-making.
